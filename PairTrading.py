#special thx to my mentor Prof Giampiero M Gallo, now a governor in Italy
#and his mentor Robert Engle, the nobel prize winner!
#for their tremendous contributions to VECM

#pair trading is also called mean reversion trading
#we find two cointegrated assets, normally a stock and an ETF index
#or two stocks in the same industry
#we run an cointegration test on the historical data
#we set the trigger condition for both stocks
#theoretically these two stocks cannot drift away from each other
#its like a drunk man with a dog
#the invisible dog leash would keep both assets in line
#when one stock is getting too bullish, we short the bullish one and long the bearish one, vice versa
#after several lags of time, the dog would converge to the drunk man
#its when we make profits
#nevertheless, the backtest is based on historical datasets
#in real stock market, market conditions are dynamic
#two assets may seem cointegrated for the past two years
#they just drift far away from each other after one company launch a new product or whatsoever
#i am talking about nvidia and amd, two gpu companies
#after bitcoin mining boom and machine learning hype
#stock price of nvidia went skyrocketing
#amd didnt change much on the contrary
#the cointegrated relationship just broke up
#so be extremely cautious with cointegration
#there is no such thing as riskless statistical arbitrage
#always check the cointegration status before trading execution

    #the first step for EG is to run a linear regression on both variables
